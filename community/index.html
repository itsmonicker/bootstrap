        <h3>GET WOMEN CYCLING (2015)</h3>
        <p class="grow">Street harassment? Helmet hair? Never learned to ride? Get Women Cycling is dedicated to growing the number of women on bicycles by providing a welcoming community for women with all cycling abilities and all cycling woes. We sent our first newsletter on April 29, and launched our first campaign #ShowMeHelmetHair on May 2. Workshops are starting later this month. Hundreds of women have already joined the movement. What about you?</p>

        <h3>CMX SUMMIT (2014 &amp; 2015)</h3>
<p class="grow">In November 2014, CMX hosted the annual CMX Summit for community professionals. 14 countries were represented at a two-day event dedicated to a field that only recently began to receive recognition. You may ask, what is a community professional and how could people in 14 countries possibly be interested in this abstract idea? 
<br><br>
    Community professionals (-managers, -architects, etc.) are people who ensure that the often anonymous individuals united by the Internet get the recognition and power they deserve. Strong communities have been the driving force and raison d'Ãªtre for organizations like AirBnB, Polyvore and Betabrand. Community professionals represent, support and enforce the altruistic side of the business. They also ensure that key metrics are met. Think of all the untapped potential of solar energy. Community management is kind of like that.

    I was on the live-blogging and social-listening team. Our mission? Let's keep the conversation going. As Marcus Graham said, "transparency seems so simple... but if you don't have the conversations, they [users] go off and have the conversations on their own. They have the speculations."</p></div>

        <h3>DUOLINGO INCUBATOR (2013 - 2014)</h3>
<p class="grow">The Duolingo Incubator platform was born to satisfy the growing demand for more free language courses. In the span of one year, a small team of developers and language experts took a website with a total of ten courses (Italian, Spanish, French, German and Portuguese, to and from English) and helped nearly 200 volunteers start 40 more. More than 11 million people have benefited from these community-built courses. There are now English-speakers learning Irish, Spanish-speakers learning Italian, and Polish-speakers learning English. People are teaching and learning languages for free all over the world.
<br><br>
I was tasked with guiding 15 teams through the ever-evolving platform, as well as communicating their bugs and UX feedback with the developers. You might ask, Why would someone dedicate unpaid hours of their day to building something he or she will never use? Despite varying in nationality, age, and personality, these volunteers all had one thing in common--none of them looked at the experience from a transactional point of view. My role was to help them achieve their dreams--helping relatives communicate with one another, saving dying languages, or simply being part of a welcoming online community with similar values and passions.
