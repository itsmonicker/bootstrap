         <div class="row"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-2"></div><div class="col-sm-8"><p>I joined Duolingo as a language expert to lead efforts on an Italian course for English speakers and an English course for Italian speakers. These two projects entailed building a 'gamified' curriculum for each course with roughly 60 'skills', or chapters which taught about 2,000 words total. These courses have drawn more than 7 million users to the website and apps.
<br><br>
Once the two courses went to beta, I took on a few new roles: maintaining and moderating multiple language-specific forums with millions of users, a social media profile with thousands of followers, as well as providing technical support to learners of both Italian and English.
<br><br>
                When the Duolingo Incubator launched, I used my knowledge of Polish to guide a team of volunteers and collaborate on the English course for Polish speakers. As the Incubator grew and we were able to identify our audiences and goals, I also helped lead the Chinese language team and escalate efforts to create a country-specific team.</p></div><div class="col-sm-2"></div>

<br><br>
    I was tasked with transcription, translation, composing comprehensive grammar notes for Italian films, as well as reviewing others' progress prior to launch.</p></div><div class="col-sm-2"></div>

         <div class="row"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-2"></div><div class="col-sm-8"><p>After a few weeks in China and several semesters of Mandarin Chinese classes, I was invited to jump on board a pilot program between HSDLAS and NYU. We were tasked with guiding ESL students through writing assignments and, eventually, college essays.
<br><br>
    We began by arming ourselves with literature by and on Auerbach and Freire. After reading up on power constructs and the educational 'banking system', we turned to translated Marvel comics. Why? We remembered how difficult high school was without the language barrier. We shared journals and open minds, and began hosting writing workshops with an attendance of 20 to 30 students.</p></div><div class="col-sm-2"></div>
